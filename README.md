# OC-SVM for prediction of Anomaly
OC-SVM can be used for prediction:
1. Keep 'nu' which defines the first boundary- stating that the anomalous behaviour has started
2. second boundary confirms the direction of the example (whether it will get anomalous or it will stay there)
3. third boundary states how rapid it will go bad.
